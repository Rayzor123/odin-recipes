<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Tahitian poisson cru, also known as "poisson cru à la tahitienne," is a
  traditional dish from Tahiti, which is an island in French Polynesia. It's a
  refreshing and vibrant dish that showcases the flavors of the Pacific Islands.
  The dish features fresh, raw fish that's marinated in citrus juices and mixed
  with various ingredients.

  Tahitian poisson cru is typically served as a refreshing appetizer or light
  main course. It's often accompanied by slices of fresh baguette or steamed
  white rice. The combination of the marinated fish, citrus, coconut milk, and
  fresh vegetables creates a delightful balance of flavors and textures that is
  characteristic of Pacific Island cuisine.

  Tahitian poisson cru not only highlights the natural flavors of the
  ingredients but also reflects the tropical and vibrant culinary traditions of
  the region.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<un>
  <li>1kg (2.2lb) sushi-grade ahi tuna</li>
  <li>
    3 fresh coconuts (or 710ml/24oz unsweetened coconut milk from a carton, not
    a can)
  </li>
  <li>
    3 bell peppers of assorted colours (green, yellow and orange), seeded and
    diced into 2cm (¾in) pieces
  </li>
  <li>3 medium-sized tomatoes, seeded and diced into 2cm (¾in) pieces</li>
  <li>1 long cucumber, peeled and diced into 2cm (¾in) pieces</li>
  <li>3-4 limes</li>
  <li>50g (3-4 tbsp) shredded carrots</li>
  <li>50g (3-4 tbsp) chopped green onions</li>
  <li>50g (3-4 tbsp) chopped coriander</li>
</un>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Cut the raw ahi tuna into 2cm (¾in) cubes and marinate them in sea water for
    about an hour in the fridge. To simulate sea water, dissolve 35g (about 2
    tbsp) of sea salt per litre of tap water.
  </li>
  <li>Husk the fresh coconuts, open them, then shred the meat into a bowl.</li>
  <li>
    Drain the tuna, then combine it in a big serving bowl with the bell peppers,
    tomatoes and cucumbers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gather the coconut shreds into a cheesecloth and squeeze all the milk into
    the serving bowl. This should yield about 710ml/24oz of coconut milk.
    Alternatively, you can source unsweetened, store-bought coconut milk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut and squeeze the limes for their juice into the bowl. Toss the carrots,
    green onions and chopped coriander into the serving bowl. Mix everything and
    serve
