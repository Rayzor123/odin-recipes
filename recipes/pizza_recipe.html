<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 ball Easy Thin Crust Dough</li>
  <li>½ cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
  <li>1/2 yellow bell pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
  <li>1/4 medium red onion</li>
  <li>1 garlic clove</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for garnish</li>
  <li>½ tablespoon capers, drained</li>
  <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>½ cup baby arugula</li>
  <li>Kosher salt</li>
  <li>Olive oil</li>
  <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make the pizza dough: Follow the Easy Thin Crust Pizza Dough recipe to
    prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to
    rest.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza
    oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).
  </li>
  <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li>
  <li>
    Prepare the toppings: Thinly slice the peppers. Thinly slice the red onion.
    Thinly slice the garlic. In a skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and ¼
    teaspoon kosher salt. Saute the vegetables, stirring often, for about 7 to
    10 minutes, until browned and very soft. Stir in the oregano and remove from
    the heat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or
    semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless
    baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well
    worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch
    Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza
    peel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a
    thin layer. Sprinkle with the vegetables, drained capers, and Parmesan
    cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza
    stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5
    to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).
  </li>
  <li>
    While the pizza is baking, mix the baby arugula with a drizzle of olive oil
    and a pinch of kosher salt. When the pizza is done, top with the arugula.
    Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
